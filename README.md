# MoTrPAC GitHub Repositories

This is the centralized hub for all projects developed for the MoTrPAC consortium. In the coming months, we will transition all MoTrPAC releated projects to the [MoTrPAC organization](https://github.com/MoTrPAC) on GitHub. Stay tune!

Please contact the [MoTrPAC Bininformatics Center Helpdesk](mailto:motrpac-helpdesk@lists.stanford.edu) if you have any questions or comments.
